        The transition model (Pr(X_t|X_{t-1) may depend on Pacman's
        current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this
        is not a problem, as Pacman's current position is known.

        In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the
        ghost, given its previous position (oldPos) as well as
        Pacman's current position, use this line of code:

          newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(self.setGhostPosition(gameState, oldPos))

        newPosDist is a util.Counter object, where for each position p in
        self.legalPositions,

        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )


        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

        You may also find it useful to loop over key, value pairs in
        newPosDist, like:

          for newPos, prob in newPosDist.items():
            ...


        HINT. obtaining newPostDist is relatively expensive.  If you
              look carefully at the HMM "progress in time" equation
              you will see that you can orgranize the computation so
              that you use newPosDist[p] for all values of p (by,
              e.g., the for loop above) before moving on the next
              newPosDist (generated by another oldPos).

        *** GORY DETAIL AHEAD ***

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining
        newPosDist makes use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule
        above:

          1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're
              tracking in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be
              used to query what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the
              ghost will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be
              placed in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition
              above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper
        methods are used and how they combine to give us a belief
        distribution over new positions after a time update from a
        particular position.

           for every ghost---so you need to change the component associated
           with the i'th ghost.). In particular, if ghost i has been captured
           then the i'th component of every particle must be changed so
           the i'th ghost is in its prison cell (position self.getJailPosition(i))

            Note that more than one ghost might be captured---you need
            to ensure that every particle puts every captured ghost in
            its prison cell.

        self.getParticleWithGhostInJail is a helper method to help you
        edit a specific particle. Since we store particles as tuples,
        they must be converted to a list, edited, and then converted
        back to a tuple. This is a common operation when placing a
        ghost in jail. Note that this function
        creates a new particle, that has to replace the old particle in
        your list of particles.

        HINT1. The weight of every particle is the product of the probabilities
               of associated with each ghost's noisyDistance observation
        HINT2. When computing the weight of a particle by looking at each
               ghost's noisyDistance observation make sure you check
               if the ghost has been captured. Captured ghost's are ignored
               in the weight computation (the particle's component for
               the captured ghost is updated the precise position later---so
               this corresponds to multiplying the weight by probability 1

          for i in range(self.numGhosts):
            ...

        Then, assuming that `i` refers to the index of the ghost, to obtain the
        distributions over new positions for that single ghost, given the list
        (prevGhostPositions) of previous positions of ALL of the ghosts, use
        this line of code:

          newPosDist = getPositionDistributionForGhost(
             setGhostPositions(gameState, prevGhostPositions), i, self.ghostAgents[i]
          )

        Note that you may need to replace `prevGhostPositions` with the correct
        name of the variable that you have used to refer to the list of the
        previous positions of all of the ghosts, and you may need to replace `i`
        with the variable you have used to refer to the index of the ghost for
        which you are computing the new position distribution.

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code above for obtaining newPosDist makes use of two helper
        functions defined below in this file:

          1) setGhostPositions(gameState, ghostPositions)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghosts in the
              supplied positions.

          2) getPositionDistributionForGhost(gameState, ghostIndex, agent)
              This method uses the supplied ghost agent to determine what
              positions a ghost (ghostIndex) controlled by a particular agent
              (ghostAgent) will move to in the supplied gameState.  All ghosts
              must first be placed in the gameState using setGhostPositions
              above.

              The ghost agent you are meant to supply is
              self.ghostAgents[ghostIndex-1], but in this project all ghost
              agents are always the same.
